// Uncomment the next line to build the QUICK-TEST version, where the pet's stats
// decay fast enough to reach a fatal level in about a minute. Leave it commented
// for the real, balanced behaviour. (See the two sets of values below.)
// #define FAST_TEST

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// STAT BALANCE — two complete sets of decay rates.
//
// The pet has three fatal stats: fullness, energy and happiness (all die at 0).
// These constants decide how fast each one moves, and therefore how
// long the pet survives if you ignore it. Getting them right is "balancing" how
// the pet behaves — too fast and the pet is impossible to keep alive, too slow
// and nothing you do seems to matter.
//
// We keep TWO sets and pick one with the FAST_TEST switch at the top of this file:
//
//   * The SHIPPED set (the #else branch) is the real, balanced behaviour. An
//     untouched pet starves in about 8 minutes — fullness is tuned to empty first,
//     before happiness or energy, so the on-screen bar is what drives the death.
//     Long enough that caring for it feels meaningful, short enough to demo.
//
//   * The QUICK-TEST set (the #ifdef FAST_TEST branch) speeds everything up so
//     the pet reaches a fatal stat in about a minute. Uncomment the
//     "#define FAST_TEST" line above when you are developing and don't want to
//     wait ten minutes to watch the pet die; comment it out again before shipping.
//
// Both sets are kept on purpose: comparing the two numbers side by side is the
// clearest way to see how the same program can behave completely differently just
// by changing these intervals. This is a compile-time choice — only ONE set ends
// up in the firmware — not a setting that can change while the program runs.
//
// In BOTH sets every stat moves by 1 point per interval, so each interval reads
// directly as "lose 1 point every N milliseconds" and the time to cross the full
// 0–100 range is simply (100 × interval).
