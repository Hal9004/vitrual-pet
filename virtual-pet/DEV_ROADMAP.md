## What this repo is

This repository is the **frozen reference implementation** for the 10-session Virtual
Pet curriculum. The code here is the complete, working Tamagotchi that every session
builds toward — students read it to learn embedded C++.

The teaching material itself lives in `LESSON_PLANS/SESSION_01.md` … `SESSION_10.md`.
Each session reveals one more feature by switching on its `ENABLE_*` flag in
`lib/Config/scaffold_config.h` (Session 1 all-off → all-on by the final session).
For per-feature status see `COURSE_CHECKLIST.md`; for the architecture overview see
`CLAUDE.md`.

## What this file is for now

This file no longer tracks task-by-task history. Its remaining job is to hold the
**bonus / extension feature designs in Appendix B** — opt-in features that were
right-sized out of the critical path but kept as deeper-dive material. The
**Session 7–9 lesson challenges point at these bonus designs**, so they must stay
here as the reference a student (or maintainer) can pick up cold.

Two project-wide conventions that the bonus designs below assume:

- **Fullness model.** The pet's headline survival stat is `fullness`. It starts full,
  decays toward 0 over time, and feeding refills it. The pet dies when `fullness`
  reaches 0, and it looks hungry when `fullness` is **low**. The accessors are
  `getFullness()` / `setFullness()`, the default constant is `DEFAULT_FULLNESS`, the
  NVS key is `"fullness"`, the stat enum value is `STAT_FULLNESS`, and the timer rule
  is `applyFullnessDecay()`. (The display-side mood name `MOOD_HUNGRY`, the
  `sprite_hungry_placeholder` art, the on-screen word "Hungry", and
  `playHungerAlertSound()` keep their names — they describe the *low-fullness*
  appearance, not the stat.)
- **Motion.** Tilt-reactive movement lives in `lib/Imu/tilt_motion.h/.cpp` and the
  shake-to-play link are both gated under `ENABLE_IMU_PLAY`.

## Appendix B — Bonus Features

This appendix holds features that were originally on the critical path
but were right-sized out of the core curriculum (kept as opt-in extensions). They are
**opt-in** — students who finish the critical path with time to spare,
or who want a deeper dive into a specific area, can attempt any of
these. None are required to complete the Tamagotchi.

Each bonus feature is documented at roughly the same depth as a
critical-path task: why, scope, a code skeleton showing the API shape,
new concepts introduced, and a stretch list within the bonus itself.
The goal is that a student (or a future maintainer of this curriculum)
can pick one up cold and have enough scaffolding to start.

Numbering:
1. **RTC Clock Widget** — display the current time on the LCD.
2. **Web Dashboard (Static Stats Page)** — phone connects to the pet, sees stats in a browser.
3. **Pet-to-Pet Stat Swap (ESP-NOW)** — two M5Sticks exchange a happiness boost.
4. **Live-Refreshing Dashboard** — the dashboard updates without page reload.
5. **Phone-Controlled Actions** — buttons on the dashboard trigger pet actions.
6. **Voice Memos** — record short audio clips and play them back through the buzzer.

### Bonus Feature 1 — RTC Clock Widget

**Builds on:** nothing — independent.

**Why this is a bonus rather than a critical-path task:**

The M5StickC Plus 2 has a BM8563 RTC chip on its I²C bus, accessible
via the `M5.Rtc` API in the M5Unified library. The original RTC
scope ("RTC overnight logic") wanted to use that chip to apply
accumulated decay during off-time, which would need Unix-timestamp
math, NVS persistence of the last-seen timestamp, capping logic so a
pet does not die after a week off, and a UI for setting the initial
time. Without overnight-decay logic, the only thing left is "show
HH:MM on a screen" — a stand-alone widget that does not integrate with
any other module. This is better as opt-in
bonus content than as a critical-path slug.

**Foundation scope:**

New `lib/Clock/clock_manager.h` and `.cpp`. Module skeleton:

```cpp
class ClockManager {
public:
    void begin();                     // sets a hardcoded initial time
    void getCurrentTime(int& hours, int& minutes) const;

private:
    static const int STARTING_HOUR = 12;
    static const int STARTING_MINUTE = 0;
};
```

`begin()` calls `M5.Rtc.setTime({STARTING_HOUR, STARTING_MINUTE, 0})`.
`getCurrentTime()` calls `M5.Rtc.getTime(&timeStruct)` and writes the
hours/minutes into the out-parameters.

Display the time as a new info row on the Stats screen, formatted as
`HH:MM`. Use the existing `printText()` helper. No new font, no new
colour.

**Verification path:** power on the device, see `12:00` on the Stats
screen, wait a minute, watch it tick to `12:01`.

**Stretch within this bonus:**

- **Setting the initial time via buttons.** Long-press Button A on the
  Stats screen to enter "set time" mode; B/C increment hours/minutes;
  A confirms.
- **NVS-persisted time.** Save the last-known time on every minute
  rollover so the pet remembers what time it was last on.
- **Overnight decay logic.** The maximal RTC scope —
  apply accumulated decay during off-time. Requires Unix-timestamp
  math, capping logic, and the NVS-persisted time stretch above.
- **NTP time sync.** Requires the Wireless Access Point primitive + WiFi-client mode (not the AP
  mode it actually delivers). Adds a real-world clock without
  manual time-set UI.

**New concepts introduced:**

- I²C peripheral access via the `M5.Rtc` wrapper (one-line API call,
  no protocol details exposed)
- Time as a struct (`m5::rtc_time_t` with hours/minutes/seconds fields)
- Out-parameters (`int& hours`) — or skip this by returning a small
  struct; pedagogical choice when implementing.

**Files touched:** new `lib/Clock/clock_manager.h` and `.cpp`,
`src/main.cpp` (instantiate and call `begin()`),
`lib/Display/display_manager.cpp` (info row on Stats), `CLAUDE.md`
(architecture map row for the new Clock module).

### Bonus Feature 2 — Web Dashboard (Static Stats Page)

**Builds on:** the Wireless Access Point primitive.

**Why this is a bonus rather than a critical-path task:**

A web server adds another module of new concepts on top of the WiFi AP primitive —
HTTP request/response, route registration, named callback functions,
`String` HTML building. We keep the
critical path at "the pet broadcasts WiFi" and let the dashboard be
an opt-in follow-on for students curious about how their phone's
browser actually talks to their pet.

**Foundation scope:**

Extend `lib/Wireless/wireless_manager.h` (or add a new file
`web_dashboard.h`) with a `WebServer server(80)` instance. Register
one route handler:

```cpp
void handleRoot() {
    String html = "<!DOCTYPE html><html><body>";
    html += "<h1>Pet Stats</h1>";
    html += "<p>Fullness: " + String(pet.getFullness()) + "</p>";
    html += "<p>Happy: "  + String(pet.getHappy())  + "</p>";
    html += "<p>Energy: " + String(pet.getEnergised()) + "</p>";
    // ... rest of the stats ...
    html += "</body></html>";
    server.send(200, "text/html", html);
}

void WirelessManager::beginDashboard(Pet& pet) {
    server.on("/", handleRoot);
    server.begin();
}
```

`server.handleClient()` runs once per `loop()` in `main.cpp`.

**Verification path:** phone connects to `PetPet-XXXX`, opens
`http://192.168.4.1/` in a browser, sees the pet's stats as plain
HTML. Refresh manually to see updated values.

**Stretch within this bonus:** the next three bonus features (3, 4,
5) all build on this one.

**New concepts introduced:**

- HTTP request/response (one route, one response — minimal slug)
- Named callback registration (`server.on(path, handler)`), which
  mirrors `addEventListener("click", handler)` from Programming II
- `String` concatenation in C++ (new — Programming II only uses
  JavaScript strings)
- "Server" vs. "client" mental model

**Important pedagogical note:** the C++ Arduino lambda form
`server.on("/", []() { ... })` is everywhere on the web but is **not
allowed** in this project (see `CLAUDE.md` — "No clever syntax").
Always use named handler functions.

**Files touched:** `lib/Wireless/wireless_manager.h` and `.cpp` (extend),
`src/main.cpp` (call `server.handleClient()` in loop), no new modules.

---

### Bonus Feature 3 — Pet-to-Pet Stat Swap (ESP-NOW)

**Builds on:** IMU shake detection (Session 3) + the Wireless AP primitive (for
the radio being initialised). Note that ESP-NOW does not actually
require WiFi to be connected — it just needs the radio to be on. The
`softAP` mode is sufficient.

**REQUIRES TWO M5StickC Plus 2 DEVICES.** This bonus cannot be tested
in a single-device setup. It is the most demanding bonus in terms of
hardware availability, but also the highest-impact in terms of "wow
factor" — two students can demo "hey, our pets just said hi" to each
other.

**Why this is a bonus rather than a critical-path task:**

Two reasons. First, the second-device requirement makes it unsuitable
as a mandatory task. Second, ESP-NOW introduces three new concepts
(MAC addresses, peer-to-peer protocol, struct-as-bytes serialisation)
that do not compose with the rest of the curriculum — students who
finish the critical path may find this content rewarding, but it is
not foundational.

**Foundation scope:**

New `lib/Wireless/peer_link.h` and `.cpp` (or extend
`WirelessManager`). Module skeleton:

```cpp
struct PetGreeting {
    uint8_t senderMac[6];     // 6 bytes
    uint8_t happinessGift;    // 1 byte — how much happy to give the receiver
};

class PeerLink {
public:
    void begin();                                  // esp_now_init, register callback
    void addPeer(const uint8_t peerMac[6]);        // hardcode the friend's MAC for now
    void sendGreeting(uint8_t happinessGift);      // esp_now_send to all peers
    bool greetingReceived() const;                 // one-frame pulse, mirrors wasShaken()
    uint8_t getLastReceivedGift() const;

private:
    static void onReceive(const uint8_t* mac, const uint8_t* data, int len);
    bool flagReceived;
    uint8_t lastGift;
};
```

In `main.cpp`'s loop: when `imu.wasShaken()` AND a peer is configured,
call `peerLink.sendGreeting(5)` (or whatever amount). On the receiving
side: if `peerLink.greetingReceived()`, call
`myPet.setHappy(myPet.getHappy() + peerLink.getLastReceivedGift())`.

**Pairing model:** for the foundation, hardcode each device's peer
MAC address into the source. Stretch: discover peers automatically by
broadcasting, or show the device's own MAC on the LCD so the
opposite student can type it in.

**Verification path (requires two devices):** flash both devices with
the appropriate peer MAC; shake device A; device B's happiness goes
up; and vice versa. Both students see "the other pet said hi."

**Stretch within this bonus:**

- **Gift items.** Send different gift types (food, toy, medicine) and
  apply different effects on the receiver.
- **Visible peer list on the LCD.** Show which peers are configured.
- **Automatic peer discovery.** Periodic broadcast packet that all
  devices respond to.

**New concepts introduced:**

- MAC address (six bytes, displayed as `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`)
- Peer-to-peer vs. client-server mental model
- Struct-as-bytes serialisation (sending `sizeof(PetGreeting)` raw
  bytes — students need to understand that this only works because
  both devices have the *same* struct definition)
- Callback registration with a C-style function pointer
  (`esp_now_register_recv_cb`)

**Files touched:** new `lib/Wireless/peer_link.h` and `.cpp` (or
extension of `WirelessManager`), `src/main.cpp` (instantiate, wire
shake → send, wire received → pet.setHappy), `CLAUDE.md`
(architecture map row).

### Bonus Feature 4 — Live-Refreshing Dashboard

**Builds on:** Bonus Feature 2 (Web Dashboard).

**Why this is a bonus:**

Bonus Feature 2 lands a static HTML page that the user must manually
refresh to see updated stats. That is fine as a teaching milestone but
not what a real dashboard feels like. This bonus adds client-side
JavaScript that polls the server every two seconds and updates the
page in place. Introduces two new concepts (browser-side JavaScript
running on the M5Stick-served page, JSON as a data-exchange format)
without changing the server's architecture much.

**Foundation scope:**

Add a second route — `/stats.json` — that returns the pet's current
state as JSON:

```cpp
void handleStatsJson() {
    String json = "{";
    json += "\"fullness\":"   + String(pet.getFullness()) + ",";
    json += "\"happy\":"    + String(pet.getHappy())  + ",";
    json += "\"energised\":"+ String(pet.getEnergised());
    // ... etc ...
    json += "}";
    server.send(200, "application/json", json);
}
```

Update the HTML page from Bonus 2 to include a small inline JS block
that calls `fetch('/stats.json')` every 2 seconds and overwrites the
DOM elements. Students have already seen `fetch` and DOM manipulation
in Programming II's DOM section, so this is curriculum-aligned.

**Stretch within this bonus:** WebSocket-based push instead of polling
(introduces a new protocol and is a lot of new code for marginal
benefit on the M5Stick).

**New concepts introduced:**

- JSON as a data-exchange format (Programming II students have seen
  JS objects but may not have used JSON for transport)
- Client-side JavaScript embedded in C++ served HTML (a tricky
  "two-languages-in-one-file" experience worth discussing explicitly)
- Polling vs. event-driven update models

**Files touched:** `lib/Wireless/wireless_manager.cpp` (or
`web_dashboard.cpp`) — add `/stats.json` route, update the root HTML
to include the JS polling block.

---

### Bonus Feature 5 — Phone-Controlled Actions

**Builds on:** Bonus Feature 2 (Web Dashboard).

**Why this is a bonus:**

The dashboard from Bonus 2 is read-only. This bonus makes it
interactive — phone-side buttons for Feed, Play, Sleep, Bathe, Heal
that trigger the corresponding `Pet::feed()`, `Pet::play()`, etc.
methods on the device. Demonstrates that an HTTP server can do more
than serve pages; it can be a control surface.

**Foundation scope:**

Add five new routes — `/feed`, `/play`, `/sleep`, `/bathe`, `/heal` —
each of which calls the corresponding pet method and redirects back
to `/`:

```cpp
void handleFeed() {
    pet.feed();
    server.sendHeader("Location", "/");
    server.send(303);
}
```

Update the root HTML to include `<a>` links (or `<form>` POST buttons)
for each action.

**Stretch within this bonus:**

- **Auth.** The dashboard is open to anyone on the AP — a "kid mode"
  password gate would teach basic HTTP auth headers.
- **Action history.** Server stores the last N actions and shows them
  on the page.

**New concepts introduced:**

- HTTP request methods (GET vs. POST — GET via `<a>` is the easier
  intro; POST via `<form>` is more "correct" and a good stretch).
- HTTP redirects (303 See Other).
- The idea that a server can have side effects on hardware state.

**Files touched:** same as Bonus 4 — extend the dashboard module with
five new routes and update the HTML.

---

### Bonus Feature 6 — Voice Memos

**Builds on:** microphone input (detect & react).

**Why this is a bonus:**

This is the **original microphone scope** before it was right-sized to a bonus. Full record + playback needs DMA-style audio buffer
handling, double-buffering, sample-rate matching against the
`M5.Speaker` output rate, and a UI for browsing recordings — three
modules of new concepts in one feature. Better as a bonus that
students can attempt after they have already shipped the simpler
"detect and react" foundation.

**Foundation scope:**

Extend `lib/Microphone/microphone_manager.h` and `.cpp`:

```cpp
class MicrophoneManager {
public:
    // ... existing detect-and-react API ...

    // Recording
    void beginRecording();                // long-press Button A enters this
    void updateRecording();               // call once per loop while recording
    void endRecording();                  // releasing Button A exits

    // Playback (uses M5.Speaker, not Microphone — left here for locality)
    void playLastRecording();
    bool hasRecording() const;

private:
    int16_t* recordingBuffer;             // heap allocated — see Hardware Gotcha 1
    size_t recordingCapacity;             // max samples
    size_t recordingLength;               // actual samples captured
};
```

Record on long-press of Button A from the Main screen. Allocate
`recordingBuffer` on the heap with capacity for ~5 seconds at 16 kHz
(~160 KB — a huge slug of memory; must be heap, never stack — see
Hardware Gotcha 1). Read samples in `updateRecording()` while the
button is held. Play back through `M5.Speaker` when a "Play Memo"
action is selected from the menu.

**Stretch within this bonus:**

- **Multiple memos.** Slot 1, slot 2, slot 3 — store in heap, browse
  with B/C.
- **NVS persistence.** Save recordings across power-off.
- **Pitch-shifted playback.** Pet "speaks" the memo at a higher pitch
  for comedic effect.
- **Memo-triggered reactions.** Pet plays back the memo when it is
  hungry / lonely.

**New concepts introduced:**

- Long-press button detection (held vs. edge — students have only
  used edge detection so far)
- Large heap allocations (~160 KB) and the importance of freeing them
- Sample-rate matching between mic and speaker
- Double-buffering (only needed at the stretch level — the foundation
  can record once, then play once)

**Critical pedagogical warning:**

This bonus is **the most heap-intensive feature in the project.** It
makes Hardware Gotcha 1 (audio buffers must use the heap) into a
concrete problem the student will hit if they ignore it. Use it as
the canonical "this is why we use `malloc()` and `free()`" lesson.

**Files touched:** `lib/Microphone/microphone_manager.h` and `.cpp`
(extend), `lib/Actions/action_menu.cpp` (add "Record" and "Play"
actions, or repurpose long-press), `src/main.cpp` (wire long-press
detection on Button A).
